# Technitium DNS Companion

A multi-node companion tool for aiding in day-to-day management of [Technitium DNS servers](https://technitium.com/dns/). Currently offers additional functionality for:

- DNS Query Logs (DNS Logs)
- Advanced Blocking App upkeep (DNS Filtering)
- Built-in Blocking pause (temporary-disable timer surfaced in the header)
- Domain Groups (named domain sets that bind to Advanced Blocking groups)
- DNS Schedules (time-window automation for Advanced Blocking groups)
- Log Alerts (rule-based SMTP notifications on query log events)
- DNS Zone Insight (DNS Zones)
- DHCP Scopes

One primary goal of this project is to provide a more mobile-friendly interface for managing day-to-day DNS functions, enabling administrators to perform common tasks (like domain blocking/unblocking) from smartphones and tablets with ease.

This project is **not affiliated with Technitium** but is built to complement [Technitium DNS server](https://technitium.com/dns/) deployments and not to replace functionality.

## Authentication (v1.4+)

As of **v1.4**, interactive UI access uses **Technitium DNS-backed session authentication**:

- Users sign in with their **Technitium DNS username/password** (and 2FA if enabled).
- The Companion stores Technitium session tokens **server-side** and the browser receives only an **HttpOnly session cookie**.
- This keeps interactive permissions aligned with the Technitium account the user actually logged in with.

Legacy “env-token mode” (configuring the Companion with long-lived API tokens) is intended for legacy/migration use only.

Security posture (v1.4+):

- Interactive UI access requires session auth (Technitium login/RBAC).
- `TECHNITIUM_CLUSTER_TOKEN` support is removed.
- Background jobs use `TECHNITIUM_BACKGROUND_TOKEN` (least-privilege) since background tasks do not have a user session.

## Use Cases

- **Mobile Management** - Block/unblock domains from your phone
- **Multi-Node Visibility** - See query logs from all DNS servers in one place
- **Configuration Comparison** - Visualize consistency across DNS nodes
- **Advanced Blocking** - Easy management of domain lists
- **DHCP Overview** - Compare and sync DHCP scopes across nodes

## DNS Logs at scale

Companion's stored DNS Logs path is tested against a deterministic database of
1,000,000 query-log rows. The final adaptive SQLite path preserves ordinary
page-one performance while removing the largest deduplication and count
hotspots:

Here, the prior behavior is the path shipped in **v1.10.1** (and earlier
releases using the same implementation); the optimized behavior was released
in **v1.11.0**.

| Stored DNS Logs operation | v1.10.1 baseline | v1.11.0 | Reduction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Domain deduplication | 2,980 ms | 136 ms | 95.4% |
| Per-client deduplication | 3,250 ms | 196 ms | 94.0% |
| Blocked-entry count | 1,300 ms | 2 ms | 99.8% |

![Four line charts showing the measured improvements for domain and per-client deduplication, unique-domain counts, and blocked-entry counts.](https://fail-safe.github.io/Technitium-DNS-Companion/performance/images/query-log-benchmark-iterations.svg)

Stored browsing also makes zero live Technitium calls for DHCP hostname
enrichment, so an unavailable non-DHCP node no longer holds historical pages
until the network timeout. Production-derived browser validation recorded 69.5%
fewer completed backend requests and lower tail latency after request
amplification was removed; the matched median was approximately unchanged.

Absolute timings vary with hardware, storage, retention, and workload. Read the
[DNS Logs performance overview](https://fail-safe.github.io/Technitium-DNS-Companion/performance/)
for the methodology, raw results, trade-offs, remaining hotspot, and
reproduction commands.

## Web-based User Interface

[Features Light & Dark Mode](https://fail-safe.github.io/Technitium-DNS-Companion/#screenshots)

## Requirements

- **Docker, OrbStack, or Podman (or similar)** (recommended for easiest deployment)
- **OR Node.js 22+** (for running directly without Docker)
- Access to one or more Technitium DNS servers (v15.3+ recommended; v14 and
  earlier are deprecated but remain best-effort compatible throughout
  Companion 1.x)
- For **session auth (required for interactive UI in v1.4+)**: a Technitium user account to sign in with (run Companion over HTTPS)
- For **legacy env-token mode**: admin API token(s) from your Technitium DNS server(s)

## Quick Start with Docker (or similar) [Recommended]

**Available image tags** (published to [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/Fail-Safe/Technitium-DNS-Companion/pkgs/container/technitium-dns-companion)):

| Tag | Description |
|---|---|
| `latest` | Stable release (default) |
| `1.6`, `1.6.9` | Pinned version tags |
| `beta` | Pre-release from the `next` branch — may include features not yet in stable |
| `next` | Rolling `next` branch head (same image as `beta`, dev-facing alias) |
| `sha-<commit>` | Immutable build for reproducing a beta result or rollback |

Want to help soak-test upcoming changes? See the opt-in [Beta Testing
Guide](docs/BETA_TESTING.md) for install, verification, reporting, and rollback
steps. Beta is never selected unless you explicitly choose it.

The fastest path is the download-and-run script (no repo clone required). For full options and HTTPS details, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fail-Safe/Technitium-DNS-Companion/main/scripts/docker-quickstart.sh -o docker-quickstart.sh
chmod +x docker-quickstart.sh
./docker-quickstart.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fail-Safe/Technitium-DNS-Companion/main/scripts/docker-quickstart.ps1 -OutFile docker-quickstart.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\docker-quickstart.ps1
```

What the script does:

- Verifies Docker is running
- Downloads .env.example into technitium.env if missing
- Shows (and can run) the docker run command
- Pulls the selected image first (so `:latest` stays current)

If `technitium.env` does not exist yet, the script will create it and exit so you can edit it. After updating `technitium.env`, rerun the script: it will confirm your desired HTTP/HTTPS ports, show the exact `docker run` command, and only executes it when you press Enter (any other key cancels).

Note: the script requires HTTP and HTTPS to use different host ports (it will re-prompt if you enter the same port for both).

For manual docker run or compose instructions, head to [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

## Configuration

Technitium-DNS-Companion's forward-looking baseline is **v15.3+**. Technitium
DNS v14 and earlier remain functional on a best-effort basis in Companion 1.x,
but are deprecated and will be removed in Companion 2.0 no earlier than late
October 2026.

#### Technitium DNS v15.3+ with Clustering (Recommended)

When clustering is enabled in Technitium DNS v15.3+, the recommended setup is session auth for interactive UI access:

```bash
TECHNITIUM_NODES=primary,secondary1,secondary2

TECHNITIUM_PRIMARY_BASE_URL=https://primary.home.arpa:53443
TECHNITIUM_SECONDARY1_BASE_URL=https://secondary1.home.arpa:53443
TECHNITIUM_SECONDARY2_BASE_URL=https://secondary2.home.arpa:53443

# Background jobs (recommended): least-privilege token
# TECHNITIUM_BACKGROUND_TOKEN=your-low-privilege-token
```

**Configuration reference:** [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Fail-Safe/Technitium-DNS-Companion/blob/main/.env.example) contains the current defaults and all supported options.

**Cluster Features:**

- Automatic cluster detection
- Primary/Secondary role awareness
- Write operations restricted to Primary node
- Automatic cluster role change detection (every 30 seconds)
- Sync tab hidden (not needed with native clustering)

#### Legacy v14 and Earlier Deployments (Deprecated)

For pre-v15 deployments or nodes without clustering, per-node environment
tokens remain available for migration compatibility:

```bash
# Each node has its OWN unique token
TECHNITIUM_NODES=node1,node2,node3

TECHNITIUM_NODE1_BASE_URL=https://dns1.yourdomain.com:5380
TECHNITIUM_NODE1_TOKEN=unique-token-for-node1

TECHNITIUM_NODE2_BASE_URL=https://dns2.yourdomain.com:5380
TECHNITIUM_NODE2_TOKEN=unique-token-for-node2

TECHNITIUM_NODE3_BASE_URL=https://dns3.yourdomain.com:5380
TECHNITIUM_NODE3_TOKEN=unique-token-for-node3
```

**Legacy configuration:** Use the per-node token section in [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Fail-Safe/Technitium-DNS-Companion/blob/main/.env.example) and review the [Technitium version compatibility guide](https://github.com/Fail-Safe/Technitium-DNS-Companion/blob/main/docs/features/TECHNITIUM_VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md).

**Standalone Features:**

- All nodes shown as "Standalone"
- No write restrictions (all nodes can be modified)
- Sync tab available for manual synchronization
- Zone comparison helps identify differences

**Production**: See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for complete Docker deployment configuration.

### Optional storage features

These features write data to disk and are disabled unless explicitly enabled/configured. If you run in Docker, keep a `/data` volume mount so the data persists across container restarts.

- **SQLite rolling query log store (optional)**
  - Improves accuracy for time-window browsing (e.g., “Last 24h”) by continuously ingesting query logs into a local SQLite DB.
  - Key env vars: `QUERY_LOG_SQLITE_ENABLED`, `QUERY_LOG_SQLITE_PATH`, `QUERY_LOG_SQLITE_RETENTION_HOURS`.
  - Session-auth note: the ingester runs as a background task and may require `TECHNITIUM_BACKGROUND_TOKEN`.
  - Docs: [docs/features/query-logs/SQLITE_ROLLING_QUERY_LOG_STORE.md](docs/features/query-logs/SQLITE_ROLLING_QUERY_LOG_STORE.md)

- **DNS Filtering History snapshots (optional)**
  - Stores snapshot JSON files so Built-in Blocking / Advanced Blocking changes can be rolled back.
  - Key env vars: `DNS_FILTERING_SNAPSHOT_DIR`, `DNS_FILTERING_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION`.
  - See `.env.example` for defaults and persistence notes.

- **Domain Groups and Log Alert Rules (SQLite-backed, shared `companion.sqlite`)**
  - Domain Groups are enabled by default. Log Alert Rules are always-on when the companion DB is available.
  - Both features share a single SQLite file (`companion.sqlite`). Override the path with `COMPANION_DB_PATH`.
  - Domain Groups optional kill switch: `DOMAIN_GROUPS_ENABLED=false`.
  - See `.env.example` for defaults and persistence notes.
