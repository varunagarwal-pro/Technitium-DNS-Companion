# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Published a user-facing DNS Logs performance overview connecting the
  reproducible million-row SQLite results, stored-page hostname isolation, and
  browser request-control measurements. The README, public documentation
  navigation, beta guide, and About dialog now link operators to the results,
  methodology, trade-offs, raw data, and reproduction commands.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Hardened trusted-header SSO.** An authenticating reverse proxy can establish identity-bound Companion sessions using a constant-time-verified proxy secret, optional immediate-peer IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs, and exact per-user Technitium cluster API-token mappings. The feature preserves Technitium RBAC and audit attribution, validates the replicated token owner on every reachable node, fails closed on malformed proxy assertions, supports direct-network break-glass login, and provides deliberate local or IdP logout behavior.

### Security

- Trusted-SSO sessions are re-bound to the same proxy assertion on every API request; missing or changed identities invalidate the local session before protected work. Identity headers and `X-Forwarded-Proto` alone cannot authenticate, mapped credentials are never returned to the browser, and operator-managed SSO tokens are not revoked by local logout.
- Trusted-SSO session creation is bounded to eight active sessions per mapped identity, preventing a valid user from growing the in-memory session store without limit while preserving multi-device access.

### Changed

- Docker Compose accepts `COMPANION_IMAGE` so operators can opt into `:beta` or pin an immutable `sha-<commit>` build without editing the maintained Compose file. Published images expose their source revision in OCI metadata and the About dialog.
- The Docker publisher now runs lint, unit tests, backend E2E tests, and the full build before pushing an image. Every published branch or release image receives an immutable source-revision tag.
- DNS Logs SQLite browsing now maintains query-planner statistics, uses an indexed status count, and selects unfiltered deduplicated rows through a shared domain/client priority index. Filtered deduplication retains its existing FTS/equality-aware path so selective searches do not regress.
- Stored DNS Logs browsing no longer contacts live DNS nodes for DHCP hostname enrichment. Background enrichment discovers enabled DHCP scopes per node, skips inactive nodes, filters leases to active scopes, and retains last-known capability across transient discovery failures.
- Paginated DNS Logs domain and client filters now coalesce typing with a 400 ms debounce. One-character client searches require explicit Enter submission, preventing broad abandoned FTS queries while preserving access to them.
- DNS Logs data requests now bypass PWA runtime caching so browser cancellation reaches the network path. Paginated navigation is serialized while a load is active, and switching from Live Tail to Paginated mode pauses automatic refresh.

### Fixed

- Release reconciliation now explicitly republishes the updated `next` branch, preventing GitHub's workflow-token fan-out suppression from leaving the rolling `:beta` image behind the branch.
- The About dialog now identifies beta and other preview builds explicitly and reports the latest stable release separately instead of saying a beta build is simply “up to date.”

### Testing

- Added regression coverage for trusted-SSO per-identity session bounds and isolation from password or other-user sessions.
- Expanded the opt-in query-log benchmark to six cumulative stages and 20 representative queries, including production-style FTS routing, planner-statistics recovery, filtered-query regression detection, per-client deduplication, and short-window behavior.
- Added a deterministic DHCP capability benchmark covering all-node fan-out, slow inactive nodes, capability routing, and cached-only stored-page enrichment.
- Added a deterministic DNS Logs interaction benchmark covering typed-request coalescing and explicit one-character client searches.
- Extended DNS Logs interaction coverage with production-HAR-derived cancellation, pagination-admission, and paginated-refresh scenarios.

### Documentation

- Added token-map creation and rotation guidance plus nginx, Caddy, and Traefik examples that remove client assertions and inject authenticated identity and the proxy secret only after forward authentication. Shared-account SSO is explicitly unsupported because it would collapse Technitium's per-user authorization boundary.
- Added the Query Log SQLite performance report with reproducible commands, raw benchmark data, accessible charts, migration costs, and the rejected all-filter dedup iteration.
- Added the DHCP capability-discovery and stored-log-isolation performance report with controlled and anonymized deployment measurements.
- Added an anonymized DNS Logs browser-request report, raw aggregates, an accessible chart, and a secret-safe HAR analyzer.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Domain Groups can be bound to every Advanced Blocking group from the Domains tab.** Dropping a Domain Group onto **All Groups** now applies the selected allow/block binding across all groups, skips matching bindings, replaces opposite bindings, and reports success, no-op, or failure feedback instead of silently doing nothing.
- **DNS Lookup typeahead avoids superseded request storms.** All Domains and exact-match searches now share a 750 ms debounce, cancel obsolete requests, retain the active search during pagination, and bypass service-worker interception for live search endpoints so browser cancellation reaches the network.

### Testing

- Added frontend regression coverage for bulk Domain Group binding plans and settled DNS Lookup searches.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **Advanced Blocking comments are visible and manageable in the Domains UI.** Existing line and block comments associated with allowed, blocked, and regex entries can be viewed, staged for editing or removal, and added to one or multiple groups before applying Pending Changes (closes #101).
- **Advanced Blocking raw JSONC editor.** Operators can inspect and edit the exact configuration document, including comments that are not associated with an individual domain, with syntax validation and revision-conflict protection before writes.

### Changed

- **Structured Advanced Blocking saves preserve user-authored JSONC.** Comments, unknown fields, whitespace style, line endings, and source ordering remain canonical while supported configuration values are patched in place. Concurrent changes are rejected instead of overwriting a newer document.
- **Comment mutations participate in Pending Changes.** Domain comment additions, edits, and removals are committed atomically with domain membership changes only when **Save Changes** is selected; Reset discards the entire staged batch.

### Testing

- Added backend JSONC preservation, mutation, revision, cluster-routing, and atomic-save regression coverage; frontend component coverage; and Playwright verification across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, and Mobile Safari.
- Isolated backend E2E databases in memory and made parallel browser fixtures collision-safe so the complete E2E suites run deterministically.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **New Advanced Blocking regex entries can be added from DNS Filtering → Domains.** Allowed Regex and Blocked Regex input now produces the existing draggable entry preview without attempting an incompatible domain lookup, while exact duplicates remain search-only (closes #95).
- **Clean dependency installs accept the committed Sharp version.** The frontend manifest now matches the lockfile so `npm ci` and the Technitium compatibility workflow no longer fail before tests begin.

### Security

- **Runtime and development dependencies received security updates.** Updated Axios and patched transitive releases of Body Parser, Fast URI, PostCSS, Brace Expansion, and Nano ID. The React Router RSC advisory was separately assessed as not applicable because Companion does not use React Server Components.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- **DNS Logs table settings are easier to dismiss on mobile.** The settings sheet now has a persistent close button, keyboard focus management, Escape-key dismissal, and an explicit dialog relationship with its trigger.
- **Installed PWAs check for updates while in use.** The service worker checks when the app returns to the foreground and periodically while it remains open so deployed fixes are discovered without requiring a manual cache reset.

### Fixed

- **Mobile and installed-PWA content respects device safe areas.** Headers, banners, dialogs, drawers, toasts, and floating controls now use browser-provided cutout and home-indicator insets instead of overlapping iPhone status indicators or screen edges.
- **The application header remains visible during iOS overscroll and pinch zoom.** The fixed header tracks the visual viewport while preserving safe-area and offline-banner offsets.
- **DNS Logs settings no longer trigger pull-to-refresh.** Opening the settings dialog disables the page-level refresh gesture and prevents modal-originated touches from arming it.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-19

### Upgrade notes

- **Container-only upgrades require no configuration or volume migration.** Existing image consumers can continue using their current environment and container invocation. The public `/api/health` endpoint and Docker image health check retain their existing liveness behavior.
- **Detailed-health monitoring now includes resolver failures.** Consumers of authenticated `/api/health/detailed` may see a node reported as unhealthy when its Technitium API is reachable but its DNS resolver health check fails. The response adds `dnsResolution`; pre-v15.3 nodes and sessions without `DnsClient: View` remain API-healthy and report `unsupported` or `unavailable` respectively.
- **The repository Compose file requires Docker Compose 2.24 or later.** It uses optional environment-file overlays so `.env.example` can provide documented, backward-compatible defaults while `.env` remains the single user configuration source. Existing container names, networks, port bindings, timezone, and storage paths are preserved.
- **Compose log retention and hardening are now explicit.** The stock service drops all Linux capabilities, enables `no-new-privileges`, and rotates local `json-file` logs at three 10 MB files by default. The published image was validated with these restrictions; deployments that replace its entrypoint or add privileged integrations should review them before adopting the updated Compose file. Log limits are configurable through `.env`.

### Added

- **Scheduled Advanced Blocking configuration sync.** Standalone deployments can periodically detect configuration drift, copy the complete Advanced Blocking configuration from a designated source node to selected targets, snapshot targets before writes, and notify operators of failures.
- **Snapshot attribution.** Configuration, DHCP, DNS Filtering, and zone snapshot history now identifies the user or background process responsible for each change.
- **Live Technitium v15 compatibility matrix.** A new opt-in Nest integration suite and GitHub Actions workflow exercise Companion login, status, settings/version, zone listing, and cluster discovery against the v15.3 minimum and latest supported v15 container.
- **Resolver-aware detailed health.** Authenticated node diagnostics now include Technitium's DNS resolution health result when supported.

### Changed

- **Technitium DNS v14 and earlier are now deprecated.** Companion 1.x keeps existing deployments functional on a best-effort basis and surfaces an actionable Overview warning. Companion 2.0 will require Technitium DNS v15.3 or later, with removal planned no earlier than late October 2026.
- **Docker Compose configuration is centralized in `.env`.** The Compose file loads the fully commented `.env.example` defaults first and overlays an optional `.env`, avoiding split user configuration and preserving the released deployment defaults. Obsolete v13/v14 sample files have been retired so `.env.example` is the single authoritative configuration reference.
- **Application and documentation branding is refreshed.** The new product icon is used across PWA/browser assets, the application header, the About dialog, and the published MkDocs site.
- **Repository Git hooks are consolidated under `.githooks`.** The existing `prepare` script now activates both the protected-branch pre-commit check and the full-workspace pre-push tests.
- **Remote-container development is treated as a personal workflow.** Incomplete public examples and documentation for the untracked local setup have been removed from the supported contributor surface.

### Fixed

- **Technitium v14/v15 authentication remains interoperable.** Authenticated API requests preserve the legacy query token while also sending the v15-preferred Bearer header.
- **DNS Override precedence guidance stays dismissed.** Acknowledging the precedence note now persists across navigation and reloads instead of reappearing immediately.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Advanced Blocking writes now target the cluster primary.** Domain allow/block changes initiated while viewing a secondary node are routed through the primary node so cluster-managed configuration remains consistent.
- **Policy changes invalidate only the affected DNS cache entry.** After an Advanced Blocking mutation, Companion calls Technitium's cache-delete action for the changed domain instead of flushing the complete DNS cache.
- **Log-page allow/block actions preserve the selected node context.** The frontend resolves the correct mutation target while retaining the originating node for status and error reporting.

### Testing

- Added backend and frontend regression coverage for primary-node Advanced Blocking routing and targeted cache invalidation.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **Multi-node login now supports degraded access.** A login succeeds when at least one configured node authenticates, while unreachable nodes are tracked separately from invalid credentials.
- **2FA login retry flow is clearer.** When a node requires a one-time password, the login form marks the 2FA field as required, focuses it, and preserves the user's username/password entry for retry.
- **Dependency constraints refreshed.** Updated backend NestJS package ranges and root overrides for patched transitive packages.

### Fixed

- **Unreachable nodes no longer trigger stale session warnings.** Nodes that were unreachable during login are excluded from the "missing node session" banner until they become reachable.
- **Invalidated node tokens are reflected in session state.** When Technitium rejects a per-node token, Companion removes that token and marks the node as failed so the UI can prompt for re-authentication accurately.
- **DNS Override evaluation defers unreachable nodes safely.** Schedule apply/remove operations now skip unreachable target nodes without marking entries as applied or clearing tracked state.
- **Manual DNS Override runs show deferred nodes.** The run result table now surfaces deferred node actions with an operator-readable reason instead of hiding them as ordinary skipped rows.
- **Overview cards keep a stable node order.** The overview page now sorts node cards consistently instead of depending on response order.
- **Node overview cache status works with async cache keys.** The cache interceptor now handles NestJS cache key tracking that resolves asynchronously.

### Testing

- Updated backend E2E tests to create authenticated Companion sessions and exercise current protected API behavior.
- Updated frontend Playwright coverage for the renamed DNS Overrides page headings.
- Verified build, unit tests, lint, audit, backend E2E, frontend Chromium E2E, production Docker image build, and container health check.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **DHCP DNS Sync page.** Operators can now source DHCP leases from selected nodes and scopes, preview DNS reconciliation, and apply the required A/AAAA and PTR record changes to the cluster primary node.
- **Primary-node DNS reconciliation API.** Added backend preview/apply endpoints that select the cluster primary as the DNS mutation target, read DHCP leases from the chosen source node, and plan forward and reverse records using each scope's domain name or an explicit forward-zone override.
- **Conflict-safe managed-record ownership.** Companion-created DNS records are tagged with managed comments, and the sync refuses to overwrite existing unowned records with different values.
- **Native DHCP DNS update guardrail.** Apply is blocked while a selected DHCP scope still has native Technitium `dnsUpdates` enabled, preventing two writers from managing the same records.
- **Managed stale-record cleanup.** Previously managed records are eligible for deletion after their lease disappears for the configured stale-grace period. Cleanup is limited to records Companion previously created.

### Changed

- **DHCP DNS Sync defaults match Technitium DHCP DNS records.** New records default to a 900-second TTL, PTR generation is enabled by default, and expired dynamic leases are ignored during planning.
- **Apply flow refreshes in place.** After a successful apply, the page refreshes the preview, shows an inline completion summary, and keeps detailed apply results available without leaving stale actionable rows on screen.

### Testing

- Added backend coverage for native `dnsUpdates` blocking, forward/PTR planning, expired dynamic lease filtering, unowned-record conflicts, apply actions, automatic snapshots, and seen-lease tracking.
- Verified the full workspace build and test suites.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **DNS Overrides page with temporary exception workflows.** The former DNS Schedules page is now a **DNS Overrides** page with a two-tab flow: long-lived **Schedules** (recurring windows) and ad-hoc **Temporary Overrides**.
- **Temporary Overrides for immediate policy changes.** Operators can create temporary overrides that force an action on an Advanced Blocking group for any selected window until a configured expiry, independent of schedule windows.
- **Email notifications for Temporary Overrides.** Temporary overrides can now create linked Log Alert email rules with the same lifecycle guarantees as schedules: rules are created/updated with the override, enabled only while active, disabled when ended or expired, and deleted safely with the override.
- **Clear precedence model for blocking behavior.** A dedicated note explains precedence now (active temporary overrides take priority over matching schedules). The note is dismissible per session.
- **Temporary override copy/edit/delete and override lifecycle controls.** Temporary entries support duplication, immediate enable/disable, and expiry-aware cleanup so ad-hoc controls can be short-lived without touching recurring schedule definitions.

### Changed

- **DNS Schedules UX cleanup.** The page label and navigation now use **DNS Overrides**, with schedules grouped under the existing schedule workflow and a dedicated temporary override tab.
- **Schedule delete safety.** Schedule deletion is now disabled while a schedule is actively enabled, matching existing override safety expectations and preventing accidental removal of currently active policy.

### Fixed

- **Schedule vs. temporary override ambiguity.** The system now applies temporary overrides with explicit precedence and state handling, preventing confusion between scheduled blocks and one-off override windows.
- **Temporary Override notification lifecycle.** Temporary Override-linked Log Alert rules are now created, updated, enabled only while the override is active, disabled when the override ends or expires, and deleted with the override.
- **DNS Filtering source-order display.** The Domains tab's **Entry sort** selector now works for expanded **Groups - Drag & Drop** lists. `Alpha` display-sorts entries, while `Source Order` preserves the underlying Advanced Blocking order, including Domain Group materialization order and manual drag/drop insertion order.
- **Temporary Override delete safety.** Active temporary overrides must be ended before deletion, preventing live Advanced Blocking entries from being orphaned while state still exists.

### Testing

- Added backend coverage for Temporary Override alert-rule syncing, active-override cleanup behavior, and Domain Group materialization source-order preservation.

## [1.6.9] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Pause built-in blocking from the header** (closes #55). New persistent pill in the app header surfaces Technitium's existing temporary-disable timer at the top level of the UI instead of buried inside Built-In Blocking → Settings. Pill shows `Active` (green) when blocking is on and `Paused · MMm SSs` (amber, pulsing) with a live per-second countdown while paused; click opens a menu with preset durations (1m / 5m / 15m / 30m / 1h / 4h). When paused, the menu also surfaces `Resume now` and re-labels the presets as `Extend pause`. Multi-node clusters fan out: the pause action applies to every node where built-in blocking is currently enabled, the resume action applies to every node currently paused, and either reports a per-node toast on partial failure. The countdown is driven entirely by the `temporaryDisableBlockingTill` ISO timestamp returned in the existing `BuiltInBlockingMetrics` snapshot (one new optional field) plus a local 1-second `setInterval`, so no extra backend polling is needed for the tick. Pill is hidden entirely on nodes where built-in blocking isn't enabled, so Advanced-Blocking-only deployments don't see a non-functional control.

### Known limitations

- **The pause pill does not affect Advanced Blocking.** Technitium exposes a native timed-disable endpoint for Built-In Blocking (`/api/settings/temporaryDisableBlocking?minutes=N`) but offers only a boolean `enableBlocking` for Advanced Blocking with no timer. Supporting a true timed pause for AB would require companion-managed state (a SQLite table tracking `pausedUntil` + `priorEnabled` per node) and a background evaluator to flip `enableBlocking` back on at expiry — modelled on the existing `DnsSchedulesEvaluatorService`. Tracked as a follow-up.

## [1.6.8] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **DNS Schedules: cannot enter multiple domain entries** (closes #69). The "Domain entries" textarea on the DNS Schedules form derived its `value` prop from `draft.domainEntries.join("\n")` while the onChange handler stripped empty lines (`.filter((line) => line.length > 0)`) before round-tripping back through the same join. The result: the moment a user pressed Enter to start a new line, the empty trailing line got filtered out, the array→string re-render dropped it, and the cursor snapped back to the end of the previous entry — making multi-line input impossible. Fixed by mirroring the existing pattern already used by the email-recipients textarea: keep the raw textarea text in local `useState`, parse + commit to the parent draft on blur. Pasted comma-separated lists are now accepted too (same split regex as emails — `/[\n,]/`). Reported by @haroldm against v1.6.5; the regression actually pre-dates v1.6.5 and existed since the schedule UI was introduced in v1.6.0.

## [1.6.7] - 2026-05-29

### Security

- **AuthSessionService now enforces absolute + idle session expiration.** Previously, server-side session entries in the in-memory `Map` had no TTL — they remained valid for the lifetime of the Node process, even after the 8-hour browser cookie expired or the user logged out. A captured session ID (via shared workstation, server-side log leak, future-XSS chain, etc.) could be replayed indefinitely until container restart. `AuthSessionService.get()` now lazily evicts on read, and a periodic sweep timer (5 min interval) bounds memory under steady-state. Defaults: 24h absolute lifetime + 8h idle (matches the cookie `maxAge`). Configurable via `AUTH_SESSION_MAX_AGE_HOURS` and `AUTH_SESSION_IDLE_HOURS`. `onModuleDestroy` stops the timer on shutdown. Identified during the post-v1.6.6 codebase-wide security audit. 14 new unit tests cover lazy eviction, sweep behavior, env overrides, and the rolling-activity case.

## [1.6.6] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Notification email templating for DNS Schedules.** Both the (new) subject template field and the existing `notifyMessage` body now support `{token}` substitution. Tokens are documented inline in the form via a chip palette that supports drag-and-drop into either field and click-to-insert at the last-focused field's cursor. A live preview pane below the chips renders against sample values derived from the current draft so the operator can see exactly how the email will look before saving.
- **15 substitution tokens**, split between static (snapshotted from the schedule at sync time) and dynamic (rendered at email send): `{scheduleName}`, `{scheduleId}`, `{startTime}`/`{startTime12}`, `{endTime}`/`{endTime12}`, `{timezone}`, `{daysOfWeek}`, `{action}`, `{groups}`, `{matchedCount}`, `{latestMatchAt}`, `{domain}`, `{rootDomain}`, `{client}`, `{nodeId}`. The `*12` time variants render 12-hour clock with AM/PM (e.g. "10:00 PM") alongside the 24-hour `{startTime}`/`{endTime}`. Unknown tokens like `{statTime}` are left literal in the delivered email so typos are visible.
- **`{rootDomain}` token** computes the registrable domain via the Public Suffix List (`tldts ^7.1.2`). For an alert on `rr1---sn-aigl6nsd.googlevideo.com`, the substitution renders `googlevideo.com`; for `news.bbc.co.uk` it correctly preserves `bbc.co.uk` since `co.uk` is a public suffix. Cleans up long, machine-generated subdomains in notification copy without losing the registrable identity.

### Fixed

- **DNS Schedules orphaned entries when the schedule's domain source changed mid-window.** Swapping a schedule's Domain Group (e.g. YouTube → Spotify) on the same target AB group caused the previously-written YouTube entries to remain in `Parents.blocked` indefinitely — the remove path re-resolved the schedule's *current* definition instead of cleaning up what was actually written. Fixed via a new `dns_schedule_applied_entries` table that records every `(schedule, node, AB group, action, domain)` tuple at apply time. The apply pass is now diff-driven: prev-tracked vs now-resolved computes additions and removals atomically, then commits tracking after a successful `setConfig`. Handles all four trigger vectors (domain-group swap, target-AB-group swap, action flip, manual entries edit) cleanly. Pre-existing orphans from earlier versions need to be removed manually via the Technitium UI.
- **Multi-schedule overlap silently broke blocking.** When two schedules targeted the same AB group with the same Domain Group (e.g. `Nighttime Block (Ed)` and `Copy of Nighttime Block (Ed)` both blocking YouTube on Edison), they each populated tracking with identical tuples. When one schedule's `remove` fired (toggle off, edit, window close), it stripped the shared entries from the AB config — but the other schedule's next apply tick computed its diff as `prev = desired = YouTube tuples` → `toAdd = ∅` → never re-added them, even though live state was now missing them. Result: blocking silently stopped working until something forced a real diff. Fixed by computing `toAdd` against LIVE state, not just against prev-tracked: any desired tuple missing from the current AB config gets re-added regardless of what we previously tracked. Same code path also self-heals external mutations (manual UI edits, conflicting Domain Groups applies) on the same tick instead of waiting for the existing N-consecutive-tick drift detector to alert.
- **Blocklist refresh hammered upstream sources (oisd.nl 429s)** (closes #70). Four patterns in `DomainListCacheService` made `Too Many Requests` responses likely from upstream blocklist providers even at the 8h refresh interval:
  - **Conditional GET headers added.** The cache already saved each response's `ETag` and `Last-Modified` to persistence but never sent them back on the next refresh. The `getOrFetchList` / `getOrFetchRegexList` paths now send `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` from the cached entry; a `304 Not Modified` response refreshes the in-memory `fetchedAt` and re-persists the same content without re-downloading the body. For large lists (oisd ~50 MB) this turns most refreshes into near-zero-bandwidth round-trips, and most CDNs don't count 304s against per-IP rate limits.
  - **In-flight request coalescing.** When multiple nodes (or concurrent code paths on the same node) ask for the same URL at the same time, only one HTTP request goes out — all callers await the same `Promise` and update their per-node caches from the shared result. Keyed by URL hash, since the upstream content is identical regardless of which node is asking. Cuts the cold-start-storm traffic by N for an N-node cluster sharing the same blocklist URLs.
  - **Bounded fetch concurrency with jitter.** Replaced the previous `Promise.all(urls.map(...))` burst in `getOrFetchMultiple` / `getOrFetchMultipleRegex` with a `runWithConcurrencyLimit` worker queue (default 3 in-flight, 0–300ms jitter per start). Prevents Cloudflare per-IP burst-limit trips when several URLs refresh in the same tick.
  - **`Retry-After` honored on 429/503.** Upstream rate-limit responses are now parsed for the `Retry-After` header (seconds or HTTP-date form). The URL enters a back-off state for the indicated duration (default 1h fallback); subsequent fetches for the same URL throw a "back-off active" error during the window without sending another request. A successful fetch or 304 clears the back-off. Logged at WARN with the duration so operators can see the back-off engaging.
- **Silent notification suppression for schedules targeting large Domain Groups.** The auto-generated regex pattern on the linked Log Alert rule (one alternation per resolved domain) easily exceeded the 300-character cap for a Domain Group like YouTube, so `syncLinkedAlertRule` failed and notifications never fired during the schedule's active window. The cap is now 8000 chars; for genuinely huge groups (>~300 domains, regex > 7500 chars) `buildAlertDomainPattern` falls back to wildcard `*` and a backend WARN logs that the alert scope has widened to "any blocked query in the target group during the active window." Both behaviors are correct since the linked rule is also gated by group selector + active-window enable/disable.
- **Email header injection defense-in-depth.** Internal CR/LF/tab characters are now stripped from schedule names and notification subject templates at the API input boundary. Nodemailer 8.x rejects CRLF in subject headers (silent notification loss); sanitizing here keeps delivery working regardless of transport behavior.
- **Migration-window cleanup gap.** Pre-tracking-table schedules that hit their first window-close after upgrade fall back to the legacy resolve-from-schedule-definition cleanup instead of silently returning. Logs a one-time `LOG` line per (schedule, node) when the legacy path engages.

### Changed

- **Per-tick tracking write churn eliminated.** `setAppliedEntries` now only fires when the desired set actually differs from prev (toRemove/toAdd non-empty OR size mismatch). Steady-state schedules no longer run a `DELETE` + N×`INSERT` replace cycle on every 60s tick.
- **Docker base image** bumped from `node:22-alpine3.21` to `node:24-alpine3.22`. Aligns the production multi-stage build with the recent CI bump to Node 24-compatible action majors. Alpine 3.22 (May 2025) brings OpenSSL 3.3 and musl 1.2.5 with security fixes since 3.21. The `node` user (uid 1000) is unchanged across Node majors, so existing `--chown=node:node` directives continue to work.
- **`AppInput` / `AppTextarea` wrapped in `forwardRef`.** Required for the new chip-cursor-insertion logic in `AutomationPage.tsx`. Audited all consumers via grep — no pre-existing call sites were passing `ref`, so the migration has zero blast radius elsewhere.

### Security

- **5 transitive vulnerabilities resolved** via `npm audit fix` (lockfile-only, no `package.json` changes):
  - `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-systemjs` 7.29.0 → 7.29.4 (high, CVSS 8.2 — arbitrary code generation on malicious input, GHSA-fv7c-fp4j-7gwp)
  - `fast-uri` 3.1.0 → 3.1.2 (high — path traversal via percent-encoded dot segments, GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6 and GHSA-v39h-62p7-jpjc)
  - `qs` 6.15.1 → 6.15.2 (moderate — `qs.stringify` DoS on null entries in comma-format arrays with `encodeValuesOnly`, GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26)
  - `ws` 8.20.0 → 8.21.0 (moderate — uninitialized memory disclosure, GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx)
  - `brace-expansion` 5.0.5 → 5.0.6 in 4 locations: eslint, glob, test-exclude, workbox-build (moderate — numeric range DoS bypass, GHSA-jxxr-4gwj-5jf2)

### Testing

- **27 new backend tests** (303 total, up from 273): orphan-prevention across all four trigger vectors, migration safety for empty-tracking apply and remove, pattern-length handling including wildcard fallback, `renderTemplate` substitution semantics, `extractDynamicTokensFromSample` parser (including sentinel-value filtering), `computeRootDomain` PSL coverage (multi-part ICANN suffixes, private-suffix collapse, IP/single-label fallback), `notifySubjectTemplate` parseDraft handling (trim, normalize, built-in-mode rejection).
- **`extractDynamicTokensFromSample`** uses strict `!== EXPECTED_SAMPLE_FIELD_COUNT` instead of `< 5` so the wrong values can't silently end up in alert emails if `formatSampleLine`'s schema ever drifts.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **DNS Logs: domain hover tooltip popped up instantly and overlapped the Block/Allow buttons.** The shared `domain-tooltip-shared` Tooltip in `LogsPage.tsx` had no show-delay, so a cursor merely transiting the domain cell on its way to a button would surface the (large) details tooltip and obscure the action target. Added `delayShow={500}` so passing-through hovers no longer trigger the tooltip; intentional hovers still resolve quickly.

### Changed

- Bumped `axios` from 1.15.0 to 1.15.2 (npm_and_yarn group, dependabot #64).
- CI workflows updated to GitHub Actions majors compatible with Node 24.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **DNS Logs: Live Tail and Live/Pause buttons appeared clickable when an End Date/Time filter was set.** Two guard effects in `LogsPage.tsx` silently reverted any attempt to enter Live Tail or resume auto-refresh while End Date is non-empty (because a fixed-end-time window is inherently a historical view, not a live stream). The buttons remained visually active, so clicking them produced an aborted-fetch (red `combined` entry in devtools' network panel) and no UI change. Both buttons are now `disabled` while End Date is set, with a tooltip explaining the reason. Clearing End Date re-enables them immediately.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **DNS Schedules drift detection.** When an applied schedule's Advanced Blocking config keeps getting reverted across consecutive evaluator ticks (another process is mutating the group — a manual UI edit, a conflicting Domain Groups apply, or an external automation), the evaluator logs a WARN and optionally sends a one-shot email alert per drift episode. Alerts debounce on the alerted-episode level: they don't re-fire until the drift resolves and recurs. Configurable via `DNS_SCHEDULES_DRIFT_ALERT_THRESHOLD` (default 3 consecutive ticks, ~2–3 min at the default evaluator interval) and `DNS_SCHEDULES_DRIFT_ALERT_RECIPIENTS` (comma-separated admin email list; empty by default, in which case only the WARN log fires).
- **`apiFetchStatus` frontend helper.** Wraps `apiFetch` with a `console.warn` on non-OK responses so that silent 404s on status-probe endpoints (e.g. a path typo, or a disabled backend module) surface in devtools instead of silently populating blank UI. Applied to 13 status/health/state GET call sites across Automation, Logs, and the Technitium context; mutation and expected-404 reads keep plain `apiFetch`.
- **Schedule detail view: message-mode indicator.** When a schedule has a custom notify message, the detail view now shows a subdued pill next to the message — either `message only` or `with technical details` — so the mode is visible at a glance without entering edit mode. Previously the detail view rendered only "(message only)" when the flag was on and nothing at all when off, so you couldn't distinguish "mode not set" from "mode set to default."

### Changed

- **Drift alert recipients are admin-only, not schedule recipients.** Drift alerts are an operator-grade signal ("the enforcement gate is not holding"), so they must not be delivered to the schedule's `notifyEmails` — those may target the schedule's subject (e.g. a child receiving bedtime-reminder emails). The drift alert now pulls recipients from the new `DNS_SCHEDULES_DRIFT_ALERT_RECIPIENTS` env var, and the `sendScheduleDriftAlert` signature no longer accepts `scheduleNotifyMessage` so kid-facing text cannot leak into an admin email at the type level. This was a behavior change on unreleased Phase B code — no migration impact.

### Fixed

- **Automation page SMTP status probe hit a 404.** `AutomationPage.tsx` called `/log-alerts/smtp/status` but the backend controller is mounted at `/nodes/log-alerts/smtp/status`; the SMTP status card silently showed blank state. Corrected.

### Removed

- **`ALERTS_EMAIL_FROM` environment variable.** Documented as a "backward-compatibility fallback for `SMTP_FROM`" but introduced in the same commit as `SMTP_FROM` (no prior version ever used it), so it was effectively a dual-name alternative that doubled SMTP config surface area with no migration value.

### Security

- **13 Dependabot advisories cleared** via flat + nested npm overrides (handlebars, path-to-regexp, serialize-javascript, ajv, picomatch). None were runtime-reachable on the backend/frontend, but the advisories were flagging on GitHub's default-branch security panel and will now clear once this release merges to `main`.

### Workflow

- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** blocks `git commit` on `main` with a clear message directing the operator to `next`. Auto-installed via the `prepare` script (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`). Legitimate hotfixes use `ALLOW_MAIN_COMMIT=1`.
- **`.github/workflows/sync-next-from-main.yml`** triggers on `v*` tag push and merges `main` back into `next` automatically. Prevents the squash-merge conflict pattern that bit the v1.6.0 and v1.6.1 release cycles.

### Testing

- 1 new kid-safety regression test on the drift evaluator: verifies `schedule.notifyEmails` never appears in drift alert recipients, even when it's populated.
- Spec fixtures redacted of private local node identifiers; replaced with generic `nodeA`/`nodeB`/`nodeC` + `example.com`.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Per-client dedup toggle** on the DNS Logs page — new checkbox nested under "Deduplicate Domains" in Table Settings. When enabled, the dedup key becomes `(domain, client)` instead of just `domain`, so each unique `(domain, client)` pair gets its own row. Useful for parental-controls audits where you care *who* queried a domain, not just whether anyone did. Setting persists to `localStorage` (`technitiumLogs.deduplicatePerClient`). Only active when Deduplicate Domains is on.
- **SQLite FTS5 substring-search index** for the query-logs DB, active when dedup is enabled. Replaces unsargable `LIKE '%term%'` scans with a tokenized shadow index. On a 1M-row benchmark DB, no-match substring searches drop from ~1.4s to ~0.04ms; rare substrings go from ~21ms to ~2ms; dedup-combined substring queries improve 15–30%. Schema versioned via `PRAGMA user_version` so future tokenizer or trigger changes auto-rebuild the index on upgrade.
- **Tier 1 SQLite performance PRAGMAs** applied unconditionally at boot: `mmap_size=256MB` and `cache_size=64MB`. ~20–25% improvement on dedup/window-function queries and up to 67% on full-scan `LIKE` queries across the benchmark suite.
- **Synthetic 1M-row benchmark harness** (`RUN_QLOG_BENCHMARKS=true`) with 16 representative query cases covering dedup on/off, dotted-substring searches, client-with-dedup combos, deep pagination, and COUNT(*) patterns. Includes a tokenization sanity check that fails fast if a rebuild doesn't populate the FTS token index.

### Changed

- **Dedup pill on the Logs page now reads `N unique (M dupes)` instead of the ambiguous `Deduped M`.** The previous wording was ambiguous — could mean either "M remaining after dedup" or "M duplicates removed." The new format shows both the result count *and* the savings at a glance. Hover tooltip updated to reflect per-client mode when that's on.
- `TechnitiumService.getClusterSettings` warning no longer mislabels transient network errors as missing-admin-permissions. Network errors (axios error with no response, so `status === undefined`) now route to DEBUG alongside 400/401/403/404 rather than WARN. Empty error messages also get a fallback string so the log never renders as `…: . Using default polling intervals.`.

### Fixed

- **Substring searches with dedup enabled return correct results.** Several rounds of FTS5 hardening got us here:
  - The FTS5 MATCH sanitizer handles dotted search terms correctly. Previously a search like `google.com` crashed with `fts5: syntax error near "."`. The sanitizer splits on non-alphanumerics and prefix-stars the last token: `google.com` → `google com*`, `www.youtube.com` → `www youtube com*`.
  - Client hostname search routing heuristic eliminates the slow `LIKE … OR FTS …` combo. Previously a client hostname search with dedup on triggered a full table scan regardless of how fast the FTS side resolved. Hostname-shaped terms now go through FTS only; IP-literal terms stay on LIKE. Typical client searches that were taking multiple seconds now complete in sub-second.
  - Added `AFTER UPDATE` trigger on `query_log_entries` so PTR hostname backfills (which run periodically as the resolver catches up for previously-unknown clients) properly re-index the FTS shadow. Previously, rows whose hostnames were filled in after initial insert retained stale tokens, causing substring searches to miss most of them.
  - Correct ordering between auto_vacuum migration and FTS5 init. `VACUUM` rewrites rowids on composite-primary-key tables; if FTS5 shadow was built before VACUUM, it silently desynced and corrupted on the next retention DELETE. Migration now runs first, FTS builds on post-VACUUM rowids.
  - Uses the SQLite FTS5 `'rebuild'` command for external-content backfills (a manual `INSERT INTO fts SELECT FROM base` registers rowids but doesn't actually tokenize content — resulting in an index where row counts looked correct but most MATCH queries returned zero).
  - Schema-version marker (`PRAGMA user_version`) ensures any FTS schema or tokenizer change forces a one-time rebuild on upgrade, even for DBs whose previous FTS state was corrupted by the pre-v1.6.2 bugs.

### Testing

- 6 new unit tests covering the FTS MATCH sanitizer (dotted terms, multi-dot terms, empty-after-sanitize) and client routing heuristic (hostname-only via FTS, IP-literal via LIKE, ambiguous fallback).
- Benchmark suite expanded from 13 → 16 query cases, adding dotted-domain search (regression repro), client-with-dedup-on (real-UI repro), and a rare-hostname variant. All pass clean on the post-fix code path.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- DNS Schedules: eager `TECHNITIUM_SCHEDULE_TOKEN` validation at startup. The token is now probed against the configured nodes during boot (not just lazily on first UI request) so missing `Apps: Modify` permission, missing `Cache: Modify` permission, an invalid token, or a transient connectivity issue surfaces as a `WARN [TechnitiumService] TECHNITIUM_SCHEDULE_TOKEN …` line in the boot log instead of when the next schedule fires hours later.
- SQLite query-logs nightly maintenance: one-time `auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL` migration on first boot (one full `VACUUM` to switch modes — fast on small DBs, may take 30s–2min on multi-GB DBs), then a daily timer at ~3:30 AM ± 10 min local time that runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` + `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum(1000)`. Without this, retention prunes never returned freed pages to the OS and the WAL could grow unbounded behind long-held read transactions. Gated by `QUERY_LOG_SQLITE_AUTO_VACUUM_MIGRATION` (default `true`) so operators with very large existing DBs can defer the migration. `companion.sqlite` gets a smaller treatment: `PRAGMA optimize` on graceful shutdown to keep query plans fresh.

### Changed

- Navbar: DNS Schedules now precedes DNS Rule Optimizer (frequency-of-use ordering — Schedules is daily-use, Rule Optimizer is occasional maintenance).
- Log Alert Rules page: schedule-linked rules now display the friendly schedule name (e.g. "Nighttime YouTube Block (Flo)") instead of the internal `__schedule:UUID__` link key. A "schedule-managed" badge appears next to the heading. Edit / Disable / Delete buttons are disabled for schedule-linked rules with a tooltip directing the user to edit the schedule on the Automation page (the evaluator overwrites manual edits on every tick anyway). Clone strips the link prefix and uses the schedule's friendly name as the source, producing a clean standalone rule.
- `[TechnitiumService]` cluster timing settings warning is no longer emitted on transient network failures. The previous WARN ("admin permissions may be required") was misleading whenever the underlying error was actually a network blip — network errors now route to DEBUG alongside other expected non-critical cases (400/401/403/404). Empty error messages are also coalesced to a fallback string so the log never renders as `…: . Using default polling intervals.`.

### Fixed

- **DNS Schedules: write Advanced Blocking config to the cluster Primary only.** Previously the evaluator iterated every node and called `setConfig` on each one, racing Technitium's own config replication. Writes to secondaries got reverted on the next sync round, the next evaluator tick saw entries missing and re-applied, and the cycle repeated every minute — visible as repeating `Re-applied schedule "…" — DG entries updated` log lines. Cache flush still hits all physical nodes since it's a per-node runtime operation, not replicated. New `TechnitiumService.resolveClusterWriteTargets()` returns `{writeTarget, flushNodes}` per candidate so multiple secondaries of the same cluster collapse to one Primary write per tick. `dns_schedule_state` now tracks Primaries; pre-existing per-secondary state rows are benign and age out on subsequent disable/cleanup.
- DNS Schedules: cluster topology probe inside the evaluator now uses the schedule token (`authMode: "schedule"`). Previously `listNodes()` always probed with session auth, but the evaluator timer runs outside any HTTP request context so `AuthRequestContext.getSession()` returned undefined and every node appeared `Standalone` — silently defeating the Primary-routing fix above. `listNodes()` now accepts an `authMode` option (default unchanged for HTTP callers).
- DNS Schedules: evaluator's remove path no longer silently succeeds when the cluster snapshot fetch fails. Previously, a transient `ECONNRESET` during a window-close tick would let `removeAdvancedBlockingScheduleFromNode` early-return, the caller would still call `markRemoved`, state would clear, and entries would be orphaned — staying live in Technitium while the schedule's tracking thought it had cleaned up. Now throws so the next tick retries until the node is reachable again.

### Testing

- 7 new unit tests for `TechnitiumService.resolveClusterWriteTargets` covering all topology permutations: standalone-only, single-cluster collapse, two independent clusters, mixed standalone + clustered, missing-Primary fallback with WARN, unknown-node passthrough.
- 6 new tests for `logScheduleTokenValidationOutcome` covering each WARN/LOG branch (full-permission success, missing Apps:Modify, missing Cache:Modify, transient network error with retry hint, invalid-token without retry hint, opt-out silence).
- 4 new tests for `getClusterSettings` error classification (network → DEBUG, 403 → DEBUG, 5xx → WARN, empty-message fallback string).
- 5 new tests for `QueryLogSqliteService` SQLite maintenance (NONE→INCREMENTAL migration, no-op when already INCREMENTAL, env opt-out, page reclamation via `runMaintenance`, no-op when DB is closed).
- 3 new tests for `DnsSchedulesEvaluatorService` snapshot-error symmetry (apply throws when snapshot has error, remove throws when snapshot has error, remove proceeds normally on healthy snapshot).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- DNS Schedules: time-window-based blocking/allow rules with day-of-week selection (any subset of Sun–Sat, or every day), start/end time, and full IANA timezone support (evaluates windows in the schedule's configured timezone, not the server clock). Schedules are bidirectional — entries are added when the window opens and cleanly removed when it closes, leaving manually-managed entries untouched.
- DNS Schedules: support for multiple Advanced Blocking groups per schedule (previously limited to one group).
- DNS Schedules: Domain Group integration — bind Domain Groups as the domain source for a schedule instead of (or in addition to) manually listed entries.
- DNS Schedules: optional cache flush on window activate and deactivate, ensuring DNS resolvers pick up changes immediately without waiting for TTL expiry.
- DNS Schedules: email notifications when blocked domains are queried during an active window — configurable recipients, per-schedule debounce interval, and an optional custom message prepended to alert emails. Set `notifyMessageOnly` to send only the custom message body (no technical details).
- DNS Schedules: Clone button on each schedule card — creates a disabled "Copy of {name}" draft pre-filled with the source schedule's settings, then opens it for editing.
- DNS Schedules: schedule token status now reports `hasCacheModify` permission so the UI can surface a clear error when the token lacks cache-flush capability.

### Changed

- DNS Schedule alert emails now use a human-readable subject line (`DNS Schedule alert: {schedule name}`) instead of the internal rule name (`__schedule:uuid__`).
- Delete schedule confirmation now uses the app's `ConfirmModal` (danger variant with animated slide-in and mobile bottom-sheet) instead of a browser `window.confirm` dialog.
- Background token security banner is no longer shown when the validation failure was caused by a transient connectivity error, preventing false-positive "token too privileged" warnings during temporary network hiccups.
- Mobile CSS improvements for the Automation page: form grids collapse to a single column at 640px, the run-result table scrolls horizontally instead of overflowing, the enable/disable toggle label is hidden at 480px, and the timezone row stacks vertically at 480px.

### Fixed

- DNS Schedules: disabling a schedule that is currently active now immediately removes its Applied Blocking entries from all nodes instead of leaving them until the next evaluator tick. The linked alert rule window is also closed synchronously.
- DNS Schedules: evaluator now performs a cleanup pass each tick to remove applied entries belonging to disabled or deleted schedules. Covers retroactive cases where the controller-level deactivation fix was deployed after a schedule had already been left in an applied state.
- DNS Schedules: switched from per-domain cache flush to full node cache flush on schedule apply/remove, ensuring subdomain entries (e.g. `www.example.com`) are also evicted when a parent domain changes.
- DNS Schedules: re-applies domain entries on every evaluator tick when a schedule window is active, so domains added to a bound Domain Group during an active window take effect immediately without requiring the window to close and reopen.
- DNS Schedules: alert rule domain patterns now match only the schedule's configured domains (manual entries plus resolved Domain Group entries) instead of the entire Advanced Blocking group. Patterns are also re-synced automatically whenever Domain Group entries are added, updated, or removed.
- DNS Schedules: alert email subject lines now correctly show the schedule's display name after the schedule is updated. Previously, rules created before display name support was added showed the internal `__schedule:UUID__` name; affected schedules self-heal on the next evaluator tick.
- Domain Management: "Apply to DNS" button now appears in the Domains tab footer when Domain Group bindings are pending, allowing bindings to be applied without switching to the Domain Groups tab.
- Domain Groups: fixed a render inconsistency after renaming a group where the right panel briefly showed the new name while the group list and binding chips still displayed the old name. Both fetches now run in parallel so the UI updates atomically.
- Log Queries: fixed app discovery incorrectly filtering on `isQueryLogger` (write-only sink) instead of `isQueryLogs` (required for log querying). Apps like Log Exporter that only implement the write interface were incorrectly selected, causing `class path not found` errors from Technitium when attempting to query logs.
- DNS Schedules: fixed a silent `RENAME COLUMN` migration failure on existing databases — a prior `replace_all` edit accidentally made the migration a self-rename no-op (`advanced_blocking_group_name → advanced_blocking_group_name`), causing all queries using the plural column name to fail at runtime with "no such column". The migration now correctly renames `advanced_blocking_group_name` to `advanced_blocking_group_names`.
- Security: updated `nodemailer` to 8.0.4 and `yaml` to 2.8.3; added npm overrides forcing `handlebars@4.7.9`, `path-to-regexp@8.4.0`, and `serialize-javascript@7.0.5` to resolve Dependabot advisories.

### Testing

- DNS Schedules unit tests: 119 tests across three suites — evaluator service (24: window logic, overnight windows, day-of-week gating, IANA timezones, apply/remove, cache flush, notification debounce), service CRUD (48: schema migration, all fields including `notifyMessage`), and controller `parseDraft` (47: validation and parsing for every field).
- Automation page E2E: 10 Playwright tests (Firefox) covering schedule create, edit, clone, delete via `ConfirmModal`, enable/disable toggle, evaluator manual run, and email notification field visibility.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- DNS Logs: fixed app discovery selecting write-only log exporter apps (implementing `IDnsQueryLogger`) instead of queryable log apps (implementing `IDnsQueryLogs`). Apps like Log Exporter that only write logs will no longer be selected as the query source, preventing the `'LogExporter.App' class path was not found` error from Technitium. Error messaging now clearly directs users to install the "Query Logs (Sqlite)" app.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Log Alerts: fixed boot crash (`no such table: log_alert_settings`) on fresh installations where `LogAlertsEvaluatorService.onModuleInit` queries evaluator settings before `LogAlertsRulesService.onModuleInit` has created the schema. Schema is now initialized lazily on first use via an idempotent `ensureSchema()` guard.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Query Logs: added a client-side Domain Exclusion List (`Exclude Domains`) with wildcard support (`*`), persisted to localStorage for per-browser noise reduction.
- Domain Groups: added global SQLite-backed Domain Group CRUD (enabled by default; disable with `DOMAIN_GROUPS_ENABLED=false`) with optional group descriptions, per-entry notes, bindings to Advanced Blocking groups, materialization preview, apply/dry-run endpoints with conflict blocking and cluster primary-write guard (override via `allowSecondaryWrites=true`), and unified export/import with configurable `domainsMode` and `domainGroupsMode` merge strategies.
- Domain Groups: apply operation uses a three-pass tracking model that records what each Domain Group last wrote per (Advanced Blocking group, action) pair, enabling zero-data-loss first-apply semantics — manually-added entries are never overwritten, and DG-managed entries are cleaned up automatically when bindings are removed.
- Domain Groups (UX): drag Domain Group pills onto Advanced Blocking groups to bind them; active bindings are shown as chip summaries within each group's expanded view.
- Domain Groups (UX): small layer icon on domain chips that are present via a Domain Group; count badge tooltip shows DG-managed vs manual domain breakdown per group.
- Domain Groups (UX): informational toast when attempting to drag-remove a DG-managed domain (entries managed by Domain Groups must be removed from the Domain Group itself).
- Domain Groups (UX): informational toast when dropping a domain onto a group that already contains it.
- Log Alerts Rules (MVP): added SQLite-backed rule storage and CRUD/enable-toggle endpoints, plus Logs page rule management UI (create/list/delete/enable-disable) alongside existing SMTP test workflow.
- Log Alerts Evaluator (MVP): added rule-evaluation status/manual-run endpoints and backend evaluator logic to scan recent stored logs, apply selector/pattern/debounce checks, and send SMTP rule alert summaries.
- Configuration Sync: Primary + Secondaries mode now fully operational — select a primary node and diff/sync its Advanced Blocking config to each secondary independently or all at once.

### Changed

- DNS Filtering and Rule Optimizer: improved Advanced Blocking capability detection by preferring `blockingStatus` node install state, with fallback to node app discovery.
- Docker Compose: replaced `wget`-based healthcheck probe with a Node.js HTTP/HTTPS probe (with protocol fallback) so checks work in minimal images without extra OS utilities.
- Persistence: consolidated Domain Groups and Log Alert Rules from two separate SQLite databases into a single `companion.sqlite` (controlled by `COMPANION_DB_PATH`, default `/app/config/companion.sqlite`). Query log cache remains its own file. Removes the `DOMAIN_GROUPS_SQLITE_PATH` and `LOG_ALERT_RULES_SQLITE_PATH` env vars (neither had shipped in a release).
- Docker Compose (production): `./data` is now bind-mounted to `/app/config` by default, so `companion.sqlite` and `query-logs.sqlite` survive `docker compose up --force-recreate` and image rebuilds without any extra setup.
- Log Alerts: `advanced_blocking_group_name` SQLite column renamed to `advanced_blocking_group_names`; a startup migration runs automatically via `PRAGMA table_info` so existing databases upgrade silently.
- Snapshot services (DHCP History, DNS Filtering History, Zone History): refactored to share a common `SnapshotFileStore` base class, standardizing directory resolution, retention pruning, and atomic writes across all three.
- Configuration Sync: sync helper functions (`computeGroupDiffs`, `computeConfigDifferences`, `computeSyncPreview`) extracted to module scope to support per-secondary diffs in P+S mode without duplicating logic.
- Toast notifications: position adjusted from `1.5rem` to `2rem` from the top-right edge for a more comfortable placement.
- Domain Groups (UX): added a `--pending-sibling` modifier style for binding chips whose partner binding in the same (group, action) pair has a pending change.

### Fixed

- DNS Filtering: fixed live search not applying filter results correctly, a save-on-change bug, a missing regex pattern guard, and improved rendering performance on large lists.
- DNS Filtering bootstrap resilience: node configuration fetch now retries transient failures, emits a load-failed UI event, and surfaces clearer user feedback via toast + inline banner.
- Domain Groups: fixed N+1 SQL queries in the materialization pending-pairs check and apply tracking bulk-load path.
- Domain Groups (UX): groups card header now uses flex-start layout so controls stay left-aligned in single-node (non-clustered) mode.
- Domain Groups (UX): fixed white-on-white text when hovering an already-selected Domain Group button.
- Rule Optimizer availability and nav gating now handle pre-auth / post-login capability hydration more reliably (reduces false negatives until full state is loaded).
- Configuration Sync: Primary + Secondaries mode no longer shows a blank UI — `targetNode` was always resolving to `undefined` in P+S mode, causing all diff/sync gates to fail silently.
- Configuration Sync: sync completion now shows a success toast; previously the post-sync `reloadAdvancedBlocking()` re-render could swallow in-component success state before it rendered.

### Docs

- Added `AGENTS.md` with project structure, development conventions, and build/test commands for agentic coding assistants and contributors.
- Docker guide now documents healthcheck probe behavior and quick verification commands.
- Query Logs filtering docs now include the Domain Exclusion List behavior (UI-only, wildcard matching, local persistence).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- Login path stability: fixed a `Maximum update depth exceeded` render loop in `TechnitiumProvider` app-capability checks by deduplicating in-flight node app requests and avoiding no-op node state rewrites.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- Health Check API enhancements and documentation:
  - Basic endpoint for container/liveness checks (`/api/health`)
  - Detailed endpoint for authenticated diagnostics (`/api/health/detailed`)
- Rule Optimizer UX hardening for safer incremental cleanup:
  - In-app apply confirmation flow (no browser confirm)
  - Redundant-regex cleanup mode with explicit messaging
  - Consistent pre/post-apply verification language and badges
- Query Logs blocked-domain insight improvements with tooltip enrichment and safer rendering guidance.

### Changed

- Authentication model finalized for v1.4:
  - Session-auth is now the interactive UI path
  - Legacy no-login interactive mode removed
- Frontend architecture and UX consistency improvements:
  - Unified snapshot drawer scaffolding and naming
  - App shell/theme context wiring cleanup
- Docker and build pipeline refinements for more reliable local and CI workflows.

### Removed

- `TECHNITIUM_CLUSTER_TOKEN` support removed.
- Cluster-token migration UI/API flow removed in favor of background-token model.

### Security

- Session-auth path enforces secure deployment expectations (HTTPS/self-signed support in backend runtime path).
- Background token model remains least-privilege focused; cluster-token path is fully retired.

### Docs

- Updated auth/session migration, health check API, and release notes documentation for the v1.4 model.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Query Logs: Paginated rows-per-page setting in “Table settings” (25/50/100/200), defaulting to 25.
- Query Logs: subtle “Source” pills to show whether results are Live (Nodes) or Stored (SQLite), plus an optional DB cache hit-rate pill when available.
- Query Logs (Stored/SQLite): response cache stats surfaced via the storage status endpoint (hits/misses/evictions/expired/size).

### Changed

- Query Logs: improved header stickiness by using a scroll-container approach (more reliable in Firefox).
- Frontend: header now measures itself and sets `--app-header-height` for consistent sticky offsets.

### Fixed

- Query Logs: paginated requests no longer force backend cache bypass; stored (SQLite) views can now benefit from short-TTL response caching.
- Query Logs: paging (Prev/Next/jump) pauses auto-refresh so the inspected page doesn’t reshuffle while you’re reading it.
- Query Logs: prevent “jump to top” when paging by keeping the current table visible during subsequent loads.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Query Logs: custom right-click context menu to copy the value under the cursor (Shift+right-click preserves the native browser context menu).
- Query Logs: optional SQLite rolling query log store for accurate time-window browsing (e.g., “Last 24h”), including new stored-log endpoints and a storage status endpoint.
- Query Logs: support `statusFilter=blocked|allowed` filtering.
- Configuration: DNS Filtering History (snapshots) for both Built-in Blocking and Advanced Blocking (create/list/view/pin/note/restore/delete), including best-effort automatic snapshot creation before Advanced Blocking saves.
- DHCP: “Preserve Offer Delay Time” option for scope clone and bulk sync.
- Split Horizon PTR: PTR record management with safe deletions, adoption of existing records, sync workflow, and history/zone snapshots.

### Changed

- Query Logs: live refresh pauses while the custom context menu is open and when an End Date/Time is set; results are ignored while the menu is open to prevent row-jumps under the cursor.
- Query Logs: date presets are disabled with tooltips when stored logs are unavailable.
- Query Logs: improved paging stability, including “click page indicator to jump to page”.
- Authentication: improved session-expiration handling and redirect/toast consistency.
- Configuration: improved domain entry sort + drag behavior.
- Frontend: added `useAuth`, `useToast`, and `useTechnitiumState` hooks and stabilized Context instances to avoid Vite HMR Provider/Consumer mismatches.

### Fixed

- PWA: reduced stale shell/cache pitfalls.

### Docs

- Query Logs: documented the optional SQLite rolling query log store and cross-linked it from server-side filtering docs.
- Docs: formatting/section-header consistency updates.

### Testing

- Advanced Blocking: added unit tests for config serialization/normalization and added backend e2e coverage for save/get round-trip (including numeric-string normalization).
- Frontend: added tests for `apiFetch` network/unauthorized event behavior.
- E2E: made Playwright mock backend deterministic.

## [1.2.5] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- DNS Lookup (All Domains): added a Text-mode “Exact Match” panel so you can confirm whether a domain exists in any list even when it’s not visible on the current page.
- DNS Lookup (All Domains): added a Regex preview panel (match count + sample matches) with a Hide/Show toggle persisted to localStorage.

### Changed

- Domain Lists (All Domains): improved paging stability and added optional deterministic ordering via `sort=domain`.
- Docker Compose: clarified default image usage vs optional local build configuration.

### Fixed

- Reduced backend CPU/memory spikes on “All Domains” by building list `sources` only for the requested page slice.

## [1.2.4] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- DHCP Bulk Sync results now include structured per-scope configuration `differences`, rendered as a readable list in the results modal.
- DHCP Bulk Sync “Sync Preview” now reports Ping Before Offer changes (including timeout and retries) per target node.
- Added unauthenticated `/api/health` endpoint for Docker health checks (compatible with session-auth mode).
- Zones: per-zone records search that matches Name + Type + Data.
- Zones: record data display mode selector (Auto/Raw/Pretty/Parsed) persisted to localStorage.

### Changed

- DHCP bulk sync comparisons now cover the full DHCP scope configuration (including Ping Before Offer fields), preventing false “matches target” scenarios.
- DHCP Bulk Sync preview state now refreshes after a sync completes so the UI does not keep showing stale pre-sync diffs.
- Docs: expanded session-auth guidance and documented v1.3/v1.4 planned variable deprecations in `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `README.md`.
- Docker dev/prod health checks now use `/api/health` instead of auth-protected endpoints.
- Zones: improved cluster-aware rendering (avoid repeating per-node cards in cluster mode).
- Zones: enhanced node accent styling (20 deterministic accents) and applied accents consistently within node details.
- Zones: improved record data Auto formatting for nested JSON strings and PTR-style single key/value payloads.
- Zones: capped zone card grid to a maximum of 3 columns on wide screens for better record readability.

### Fixed

- DHCP Scopes page now renders correctly on small screens (tab switcher overflow) and the DHCP Scope History pull button no longer gets hidden behind the sticky footer.
- Fixed false Docker “unhealthy” status when session auth is enabled (healthcheck no longer hits `/api/nodes`).

## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- Fixed Docker images boot-looping due to missing runtime dependencies in npm workspaces (hoisted deps like `@nestjs/common` were not present in the final image). (#26)

### Changed

- CI: generate Docker metadata tags for PR and branch builds to avoid “no tags generated” warnings during PR builds.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- Reduced excessive DNS lookups during Query Logs auto-refresh by reusing keep-alive HTTPS agents for Technitium API calls and caching cluster hostname resolution results (#23). (Thanks to @durandguru for the report!)

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- Optional session-based authentication (now required in v1.4+) using HttpOnly cookies and server-side session storage.
- Dedicated `TECHNITIUM_BACKGROUND_TOKEN` support so background PTR/hostname work can run safely in session-auth mode.
- Guided migration from `TECHNITIUM_CLUSTER_TOKEN` → `TECHNITIUM_BACKGROUND_TOKEN`, including token creation + validation.
- Backend Jest tests and frontend Vitest/RTL tests covering the new auth + migration flows.
- Support for Technitium AdvancedBlockingApp v10+ refresh interval minutes via `blockListUrlUpdateIntervalMinutes`.
- UI inputs for list source refresh interval in hours + mins.

### Changed

- Auth UX only requires the login page when session auth is enabled.

### Fixed

- Reduced/no-op behavior for background PTR warming when it cannot run (e.g., no request/session context), preventing noisy failures.
- Request-context middleware registration to avoid intermittent auth/session issues across routes.
- List source refresh interval no longer appears stuck due to a cached reload after saving.
- Minutes input UX: allows clearing the default `0` while typing (prevents "0" from snapping back mid-edit).
- Added frontend regression test for the minutes input editing behavior.

### Security

- Token capability validation for `TECHNITIUM_BACKGROUND_TOKEN` (must be least-privilege); unsafe/unverifiable tokens disable background PTR warming and surface warnings.
- Implemented a session-token-first approach using Technitium `/api/user/login` expiring tokens (no long-lived admin API tokens by default), while preserving backwards-compatible env-token “service mode”.
- When using session auth, the backend requires HTTPS and supports TLS-terminating reverse proxies via `TRUST_PROXY=true`.

## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- Automatic snapshot creation before bulk sync kicks off, ensuring every affected node has a rollback point without any manual prep.
- Zero-scope onboarding flow that surfaces a guided form for creating the very first DHCP scope on a node without leaving the Scopes tab.
- Guided bulk sync modal entry point inside the zero-scope panel so empty nodes can clone a working configuration with one click.
- DHCP Scope History drawer that lists snapshots, exposes pin/restore/delete/note actions, and surfaces success toasts after restores.
- Drawer-pull button plus supporting layout styles so the history drawer is reachable from mobile and desktop alike.
- About modal now performs a cached (12-hour) GitHub release check and highlights when a newer version of Technitium DNS Companion is available.

### Changed

- “Launch guided bulk sync” now preserves the active Scopes tab and automatically re-focuses it after closing the dialog to keep users oriented.
- Guided bulk sync modal now uses a dedicated overlay + dialog layout, ensuring it renders centered above the page with consistent spacing on desktop and mobile.
- Inline bulk sync workflow preloads scope details for diff previews, adds loading/empty states, and clarifies node/strategy messaging so administrators can trust the preview before syncing.
- Confirm modal buttons and global button styles were refreshed (ghost variant, consistent spacing) to match the latest UI system and improve accessibility.
- Snapshot drawer controls now share the same visual language as the rest of the UI, making pinning, note editing, and restore confirmation dialogs feel native.

### Fixed

- Guided bulk sync dialog no longer appears inline at the bottom of the page; the overlay fully covers the viewport and traps focus like a proper modal.
- Snapshot drawer interactions now emit success messaging after restores so operators know when scopes have been rolled back.

## [1.1.5] - 2025-12-11

### Added

- Bulk DHCP sync workflow that copies scopes across nodes, complete with diff previews, backend safeguards, and updated documentation (#16).
- Expanded UI visual guide with before/after comparisons to document the refreshed design language.

### Changed

- Frontend test stack now includes `@testing-library/user-event`, making interaction-heavy tests far easier to author.

## [1.1.4] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- OCI-compatible Docker image annotations (org.opencontainers labels) so deployed containers report version metadata automatically.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- MkDocs-powered documentation site (with image lightbox support and example environment files) for easier onboarding (#14).
- Built-in blocking enhancements, wildcard-aware zone sorting, and major DHCP page refactors that pave the way for future automation (#11/#12/#13).

### Changed

- Docker quickstart docs were rewritten for clarity, including refreshed screenshots and streamlined copy/paste helpers.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Reusable `ConfirmModal` component that replaces browser dialogs and standardizes destructive-action prompts across the app.

### Fixed

- Cluster settings retrieval now logs actionable errors, and DHCP domain search lists correctly mark modifications.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed

- Cluster node auto-detection now resolves DNS names even when nodes are referenced by IP-based `baseUrl` values, preventing mismatched writes.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- End-to-end Docker build hardening: BuildKit cache mounts, GHCR workflow, rollup/esbuild platform fixes, and version tagging inside published images.
- First wave of UI polish including About modal, DNS Lookup rename, and mobile-friendly tweaks spanning DHCP + configuration pages (#3-#6).
- Built-in blocking management UI plus supporting backend hooks for advanced filtering (#7).

### Fixed

- Sample configs, README quickstart commands, and Docker docs were cleaned up for public consumption.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-24

- Initial public release of Technitium DNS Companion with responsive React frontend, NestJS backend, and multi-node Technitium DNS management.
